# Stake-for-Service (SfS) Budget Calculator (Rialo Builders Hub demo)

A **tiny static website** you can deploy with GitHub Pages in minutes.

It helps you demo a simple question:

> If a reactive, recurring workflow runs N times/day and each run costs X (credits), can routed staking yield cover it forever?

## What it demonstrates (conceptually)

- **Stake-for-Service (SfS)**: routing a fraction of staking yield into **service credits** (via ServicePaymaster) to automatically pay for gas/storage/scheduled executions.
- **Reactive transactions / native automation**: workflows that can execute when predicates/conditions are met.

## Quick start (no coding)

1. Download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Pick a **Scenario preset** (or edit numbers).
4. Share your screen and walk through the results.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., `rialo-sfs-budget-calculator`).
2. Upload these files (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, `README.md`).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch** and select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Your site will be published at a GitHub Pages URL.

## Suggested Builders Hub story

1) “Reactive transactions can trigger execution natively (time/price/events).”
2) “SfS routes yield into credits so recurring execution can be self-funding.”
3) “This calculator shows whether the workflow is sustainable under assumptions.”
