# Stake-for-Service (SfS) Budget Calculator (Rialo Builders Hub demo)

> If a reactive, recurring workflow runs N times/day and each run costs X (credits), can routed staking yield cover it forever?

## What it demonstrates (conceptually)

- **Stake-for-Service (SfS)**: routing a fraction of staking yield into **service credits** (via ServicePaymaster) to automatically pay for gas/storage/scheduled executions.
- **Reactive transactions / native automation**: workflows that can execute when predicates/conditions are met.

## Quick start

1. Download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Pick a **Scenario preset** (or edit numbers).
4. Share your screen and walk through the results.

## Suggested Builders Hub story

1) “Reactive transactions can trigger execution natively (time/price/events).”
2) “SfS routes yield into credits so recurring execution can be self-funding.”
3) “This calculator shows whether the workflow is sustainable under assumptions.”
